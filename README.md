# DOM Mini-Games

### Challenge 1

Make a checklist application. It should have an input field at the top, so you can add new items to the checklist. On click, items should be marked complete, with strike-through text and a checkmark. If they are clicked again, they can be unchecked. 

Use CSS and Emoji to make a great looking app!

### Challenge 2 

Build a calendar/clock application. It should be able to display the current time, date and day of the week.  It should also have an input field for adding reminders.

### Challenge 3

Choice a)
A two player noughts and crosses. You know the rules. Build it! If you're feeling fancy you may want to include a score counter, and alternate the player that goes first. 

Choice b)

A two player Connect Four game. This is very similar to the noughts and crosses game, but with harder logic. You decide which one to implement!

### Challenge 4

Make a photo-gallery application.  It should have an input field which can be used to search for an image, which in turn should trigger an API call to a site such as (https://www.flickr.com/) or another API that serves up photos. 

You should think carefully beforehand about how the data you get back should be displayed to the user.

### Challenge 5

[Battleships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). Build a Battleship game to be played with two people. To begin with, you may wish to start the ships in the same place every time, as placing them can be quite tricky! You should take into account that neither player should be able to see each other's side of the board, so the game should include a turn-taking mechanism, which obscures the opponent's side of the board. 


### Challenge 6

A [Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)). Build a Simon game that provides a user with sound/colour based patterns, which the user should remember and repeat. The pattern should get incrementally more difficult for the user to recall.`
