# DOM Mini-Games

### Challenge 1

Make a checklist application. It should have an input field at the top, so you can add new items to the checklist. On click, items should be marked complete, with strike-through text and a checkmark. If they are clicked again, they can be unchecked. 

Use CSS and Emoji to make a great looking app!

### Challenge 2 

Digital alarm clock. Build a digital alarm clock, which shows the current time in the browser. You should be able to set alarms to go off at certain times. 

### Challenge 3

Choice a)
A two player noughts and crosses. You know the rules. Build it! If you're feeling fancy you may want to include a score counter, and alternate the player that goes first. 

Choice b)

A two player Connect Four game. This is very similar to the noughts and crosses game, but with harder logic. You decide which one to implement!

### Challenge 4

[Battleships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)). Build a Battleship game to be played with two people. To begin with, you may wish to start the ships in the same place every time, as placing them can be quite tricky! You should take into account that neither player should be able to see each other's side of the board, so the game should include a turn-taking mechanism, which obscures the opponent's side of the board. 


### Challenge 5

A [Simon Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)). Build a Simon game that provides a user with sound/colour based patterns, which the user should remember and repeat. The pattern should get incrementally more difficult for the user to recall.`
